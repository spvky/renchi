# Design approach
* Every entity should have some novel interaction with each other/map features (water, electric), it's okay if there are a few cases that don't, but while considering a feature/entity, try not to add any 'single' use mechanics, point everything towards immergent design

## Box
Water: Makes boxes float to the top
Electricity: Non conductive platform
Wind: Will gradually blow boxes

## Water
Electricity: Water conducts electricity
Wins: If wind blows a falling water stream, it disperses it in to mist
